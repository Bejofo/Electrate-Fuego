  <!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career.
   In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level 
   of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your 
   field or future career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes...improving the world. 
   Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes" in your own life?
    Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you? 
    Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that begins with "Lorem ipsum."-->

  <div class="textblock">
    <h2>why </h2>

    <p>i played too much video games as a kid, and this led to me studying computer science.</p>

  <!--Replace the image here. You can also control image width and height %.
   This is the second way we can control the size of images on our website.-->

  <!--in this next section you will explain a little more about your family
   (what does family means to you? Who are the people that influenced you on this path along which you now stand).-->

  <div class="textblock">
    <h2>Family?</h2>
  </div>

  <!--Show us. Find those beautiful, meaningful "family" photos and pictures of your place (only you can define family). 
  If you are concerned about issues of privacy, you can always use stock images, or get creative. 
  Add these photos to your project folder, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace the names in the grid code below. 
  You can add more images if you wish, or subtract...you might also need to move content around to achieve balance. 
  See what happens – sometimes you have to be playful to find the purpose of things. Since these images are smaller, 
  you will want to resize your images to less than 600px in width. This will improve load time and thus general accessibility. 
  Don't forget to add alt="text"-->
  <!--A photo grid uses rows and column classes to create some divisions on the page that will scale with mobile devices. The style.css page provides other attributes that will adjust the image depending on the size of screens.-->

  <div class="row">
    <div class="column">

    <div class="column">
      <img src="mom.webp" alt="mom">
      <img src="sister.png" alt="sister">
    </div>
  </div>

  <!--Time to write. Flesh it out! Define family, 
  qualify it, explicate it telling us why these people are important, 
  and how they contributed to how you got here and where you are going. 
  What about "home." What  does that mean to you? In what ways is it significant in determining where your are going? 
  Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that says "Lorem ipsum."-->

  <div class="textblock">
    <p>Try guessing who is who</p>

  <!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. T
  his might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person,
   how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. 
   So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. 
   You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content.
    You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements)
     perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment. 
     You can't break this thing, right? Control Z. Control Z. Control Z... -->

      I often feel like I missed out on early internet culture, from what I heard it was the wild west, but hidden in the corners 
      you can find niche, esoteric, yet tight-knit communities. It was an escape from reality, where anyone can become anyone they want.
      Now the modern web feels more like an extension of reality rather than seperate from it.
      Everything feel much more corporate and depersonalized.
